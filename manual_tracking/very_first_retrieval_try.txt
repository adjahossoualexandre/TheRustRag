text: For example, the index
could be coming from a person entering a number. If they accidentally enter a
number that’s too large and the program gets a None value, you could tell the
user how many items are in the current vector and give them another chance to
enter a valid value. That would be more user-friendly than crashing the program
due to a typo!
When the program has a valid reference, the borrow checker enforces the
ownership and borrowing rules (covered in Chapter 4) to ensure this reference
and any other references to the contents of the vector remain valid. Recall the
rule that states you can’t have mutable and immutable references in the same
scope. That rule applies in Listing 8-6, where we hold an immutable reference
to the first element in a vector and try to add an element to the end. This
program won’t work if we also try to refer to that element later in the
function.

text: We also don’t know the concrete lifetimes of the
references that will be passed in, so we can’t look at the scopes as we did in
Listings 10-17 and 10-18 to determine whether the reference we return will
always be valid. The borrow checker can’t determine this either, because it
doesn’t know how the lifetimes of x and y relate to the lifetime of the
return value. To fix this error, we’ll add generic lifetime parameters that
define the relationship between the references so the borrow checker can
perform its analysis.
Lifetime Annotation Syntax
Lifetime annotations don’t change how long any of the references live. Rather,
they describe the relationships of the lifetimes of multiple references to each
other without affecting the lifetimes. Just as functions can accept any type
when the signature specifies a generic type parameter, functions can accept
references with any lifetime by specifying a generic lifetime parameter.

text: In practice, it means that the lifetime of the reference returned by the
longest function is the same as the smaller of the lifetimes of the values
referred to by the function arguments. These relationships are what we want
Rust to use when analyzing this code.
Remember, when we specify the lifetime parameters in this function signature,
we’re not changing the lifetimes of any values passed in or returned. Rather,
we’re specifying that the borrow checker should reject any values that don’t
adhere to these constraints. Note that the longest function doesn’t need to
know exactly how long x and y will live, only that some scope can be
substituted for 'a that will satisfy this signature.
When annotating lifetimes in functions, the annotations go in the function
signature, not in the function body. The lifetime annotations become part of
the contract of the function, much like the types in the signature. Having
function signatures contain the lifetime contract means the analysis the Rust
compiler does can be simpler.
